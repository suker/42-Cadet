# 42TESTERS-GNL

This is a complete tester for the 2019 version of the 42 project GetNextLine.
However it does not test leaks in as much detail as the moulinette. /!\

If you want to be a good developer, please make your own tests. You should only use testers when you're correcting someone or just before submitting your work to see what tests you haven't thought of doing. If you finish a project without testing it yourself, you've only done a quarter of it.

1 - cd to the folder with your fonctions

2 - git clone https://github.com/Mazoise/42TESTERS-GNL.git 

3 - cd 42TESTERS-GNL

4 - bash all_tests.sh or all_tests_with_bonus.sh
