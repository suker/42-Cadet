"He can't go out! He shan't go out!
He won't be safe!" she said -
She sadly sighed and cried with doubt:
"He'll stay inside instead!

The world's a dark and dreadful
place For tiny helpless boys -
We have to make a safer space;
A shielded life of joys!"

"There's evil beasts at every bend,
And danger waits ahead!
It has to stop. It has to end.
He can't go out!" she said.

"Oh dearest darling wife of mine," The other whispered, sad:
"Just let him go - and he'll be fine," Said Little Timmy's dad.

So Little Timmy's mum agreed, And Timmy went outside.
But Timmy met one of those kidnapping-rapist-pedo-meth-addicts that are everywhere nowadays.
And Timmy fucking died.
