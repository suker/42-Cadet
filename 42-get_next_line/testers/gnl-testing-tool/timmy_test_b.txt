When Little Timmy took an 'E'
To while away the night:
'I barely felt a thing,' said he,
And spoke, 'this can't be right.'

He waited half a second's span -
A moment more, or two -
And when, at last, the next began,
He wondered what to do.

'Perhaps it takes a few before
It settles in,' he sighed.
So Timmy swallowed sixty more.

And Timmy fucking died.
