TCP is a connection-oriented protocol
TCP does not support broadcasting
TCP provides extended error checking mechanisms. This is because it provides flow control and data acknowledgement
Data sequencing is a TCP feature (this means that packets arrive in order in the recipient)
The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in TCP
TCP is reliable because it guarantees the delivery of data to the router of the destination
